# Bootcamp

Welcome to our bootcamp reference material!

Here you can find all the information on how the bootcamp works. From the course materials, to the schedule and our projects.

This repository is for everyone to click around and contribute with a pull request.

This project is heavily inspired by [Founders and Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/).


## Table of contents

- [Prebootcamp](prebootcamp/README.md)—or what you should do before the bootcamp
- [Week 1 - Toolkit & advanced JS](week-1/README.md)—on working together, and a bit more JavaScript
- [Week 2 - Testing](week-2/README.md)—on writing tests

## Planning

The course material is developed following the Founders and Coders' [curriculum planning](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/curriculum-planning).
