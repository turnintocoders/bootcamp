You can find more material below, that might help working on the prerequisites. If you ever get stuck remember our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/turnintocoders/codingforeveryone) and our [Monday evening meetups](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/), we are here to help!


## Precourse material

The following material is meant as a reference for what you are expected to know before the bootcamp, but maybe you are not familiar yet. There's no particular order for the following sections, feel free to jump around as you prefer.

### Outline

- [Command line](#command-line)
- [Git & Github](#git--github)
- [Markdown](#markdown)
- [Semantic HTML](#semantic-html)
- [CSS](#css)
- [DOM manipulation](#dom-manipulation)
- [Practical project](#practical-project)
- [Installation list](#installation-list)
- [Optional extras](#optional-extras)

### Command line

Having used the command line before the bootcamp is essential. You are not expected to be a pro, but you need to know your way around.

Learning outcomes:
  - be familiar with navigating around your computer without using a GUI
  - become proficient in typing

Resources:
  - start by watching and repeating the commands of this [gentle tutorial introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFMyUgF6I8Y).
  - if you have time, go deeper with [Learn enough command line to be dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial)
  - please please please become a decent typist. It will pay off for the rest of your working career as probably you'll be typing all the way through. You can learn at [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/) and have some fun at [typeracer](http://play.typeracer.com/)


### Git & Github

To collaborate with other on code you need to know the basics of Git and Github.

Learning outcomes:
  - understand why we need Git and Github
  - know the basic commands: `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`
  - know the basics of Git/Github: pull requests, fork, branches

Resources:
  - if you have no idea what we are talking about you can watch this [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-) from Github (total of ~80 minutes, at normal speed)
  - then be sure to put it into practice, at least by setting up your Github page. There is a [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) for that too


### Markdown

To share information on Github and beyond you need a way to format text. An easy way to do that on plain text files is Markdown.

Learning outcomes:
  - be able to write simple documents in Markdown

Resources:
  - you can read [this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) from Github again. Be sure to try that out yourself by writing some documentation or presentation of your website hosted in the Github pages


### Semantic HTML

Writing HTML that is semantically meaningful is very important for both machines and humans. Machines (e.g. search engines) can better understand what is going on in our content. Humans using screen readers or different navigation tools can benefit from a more semantically structured document.

Learning outcomes:
  - be familiar with HTML5 elements
  - understand why and how we need to write semantic HTML

Resources:
  - in [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/the-importance-of-sections) you'll find a good explanation about why semantic is important and a bit of history behind it
  - then try to use different [elements from this list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to become familiar with them


### CSS

Every project in the bootcamp will have a frontend side. It's important to be able to present the projects in a clean and organised way. We don't need to go fancy, but we need to be able to stay clean, legible and responsive.

Learning outcomes:  
  - understand basic CSS rules
  - understand different positioning techniques: `relative`, `absolute`, `float`, `flex`
  - understand font sizing techniques: `em`, `rem`, `px`

Resources:
  - [Learn Layout](http://learnlayout.com) is a great introduction to most of the useful CSS concepts that you'll need
  - [Fundamental text and font styling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals) will guide you through everything you need to know about styling text

Optional resources:
  - you can carry on with the rest of the [MDN CSS guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) to learn more about styling boxes and more about layouts, beyond what you've seen in [Learn Layout](http://learnlayout.com)


### DOM manipulation

The DOM is the internal browser representation of the HTML page. It is useful to know how it works because we will use it all the time to create, modify and animate our pages using JavaScript.

Learning outcomes:
  - understand what the DOM is
  - create, access, move and style a DOM element

Resources:
  - [The DOM: What's the Document Object Model?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/videos/the-dom-whats-the-document-object-model)
  - [live coding introduction to the DOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaLKqoB9Fu0) with JavaScript examples
  - [a more comprehensive guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents) to the DOM manipulation with exercises
  - you can find more exercises that you can do directly in the browser at [Appspot's DOM Tutorials: Exercises 1,2 & 3 only](https://dom-tutorials.appspot.com/static/index.html)


### Practical project

To really understand what you have gone through so far you need to start a small project from scratch. That can be the [Github page](https://pages.github.com/) from the prerequisites or something else that you like. Whatever is your choice, take some time to build a .

Learning outcomes:
  - cement your knowledge of the concepts above through practical application

Example tasks:
  - build a calculator. This is one of the [Free Code Camp's projects](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator). Feel free to pick another one
  - build a responsive landing page with some interactivity (e.g. hamburger menu)
  - come up with whatever you like!

You should do this directly with your text editor, terminal and browser. Start by creating your repository on GitHub and try to stick to the command line for adding, committing and pushing your changes as you go. It is not important to get a polished product. Even if it is minimal, make sure to get something online.


## Installation List

To avoid wasting time during the bootcamp you should follow this installation list on your own. We will meet one day before the bootcamp to make sure that you are all set, but try this alone first.


### For macOS

Install:
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

Install [Ubuntu LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) following the links in that page.

You can use [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) to burn the image on a USB stick.


### For Linux

You are set. We recommend [Ubuntu LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). But if you are familiar with anything else, it's fine. The tools that we are using will be tested and supported only for that distribution though.


### For everyone

Install:
  - [Atom](https://atom.io/) with these plugins:
    - linter-eslint and its dependencies
    - open-in-browser
    - autocomplete-paths
    - pigments
    - color-picker
  - [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

[Setup SSH access to your Github account](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/)


## Optional extras

Extra introductory material that could help you better understand what we are talking about. You are not expected to go through all this before, but you might need to learn more during the bootcamp.


### Web

A list of all the keywords you will hear over and over again, explained: [how the Web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works).

The mistery of getting your website online: [publishing your website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Publishing_your_website).
